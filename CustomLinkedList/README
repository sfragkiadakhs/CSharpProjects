This assignement's purpose is to understand how to implement Custom linked lists. 

The following interface was given with instructions to implement all of its corresponding methods.

public interface ILinkedList<T> : ICollection<T>
{
    void AddToFront(T item);
    void AddToEnd(T item);
}

The class implementing the interface, is called CustomLinkedList and uses the nested class Node to implement a single-linked list.
